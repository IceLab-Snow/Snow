# Snow Vite App

This project restructures the existing pages into a minimal React + TypeScript application powered by Vite.

Each page exposes helper functions that return placeholder data. Replace these implementations with real API calls.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
